Hello everyone! My name is Leonid Yatskevich and I am a data analyst / scientist. I am excited to be part of this community and share my knowledge and experience with you all.

Data has always been a passion of mine and I find great satisfaction in uncovering insights and trends hidden within it. I have a strong technical background in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, and I enjoy using these skills to solve real-world problems.

I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from predictive modeling and data visualization to data-driven decision making and strategy. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data sets and experimenting with new tools and techniques. I also enjoy presenting my findings and insights to others, and I am always open to feedback and suggestions.

Let's connect and work together to make the most of our data!
